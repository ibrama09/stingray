                                <p>Stingrays belong to a group of fish known as rays. Sharks, skates, and rays are all related, forming a family of fish that have skeletons made of gristly cartilage rather than of bone. Rays often lie on the seabed, where their flat shape and coloring make them very difficult to see. Although many rays are harmless, some will quickly attack if they are stepped on or disturbed</p>
                                <p>Stingrays are found in warm, tropical waters around the world. They get their name from the sharp spines that grow near the base of their long, thin tails. The spines are dangerous weapons. If an enemy gets too close, the stingray whips its tail around and drives the spine onto its victim's body. The spine is coated with poison and inflicts an extremely painful, though rarely fatal, wound. Several human swimmers have died after being stung in the chest or stomach by stingrays. Stingray spines were once used by local people as weapons and are sometimes unfortunately sold as letter openers to tourists.</p>

                            <p>Up to 5 ft wide, this stingray lives along the Atlantic coast of the United States, Central America, and the Caribbean. It usually lies on the seabed, half-buried in the sand. Here it feeds on scraps of fish, crabs, and shellfish that it sucks in and crushes with its strong teeth.</p>
                            <p>The deadly spine on the stingray's tail is between 1 and 15 inches long. It is needle-sharp, has serrated edges, and is highly poisonous. The stingray uses its whiplike tail with great speed and force to drive the spine into an attacker, such as a shark.</p>
                            <p>The stingray's side fins are shaped like triangular wings. The ray flaps them gently up and down as it swims, almost as if it is flying underwater.</p>

                            <p>These rays grow to about 6 ft in width. They swim fast through the water, flapping their huge, pointed fins like wings. They find their prey on the seabed by squirting water out of their mouths to blow away the sand.</p>

                            <p>Torpedo rays use electric shocks to stun or kill their prey. The shock would be strong enough to throw a human to the ground.</p>
